        <h3>What is Rogue Scholar?</h3>
        <p>
          Rogue Scholar is an open access archive and registry for science blogs.
          It preserves science blog posts, makes them citable via
          <a href="https://doi.org">DOI</a>, and ensures their long-term
          discoverability alongside formal scholarly literature.
        </p>

        <h3>Why science blogs?</h3>
        <p>
          Science blogs are an important but often overlooked part of scholarly
          communication. Researchers share preliminary findings, discuss methods,
          explain complex topics to the public, and engage in scientific debate
          long before — or instead of — formal publication. Rogue Scholar gives
          these contributions the same citability and discoverability as journal
          articles.
        </p>

        <h3>Key features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>DOI registration</strong> – Every archived blog post receives
            a persistent DOI, enabling reliable citations and cross-links.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structured metadata</strong> – Author names, ORCID iDs,
            affiliations, subjects, licenses, and publication dates are captured
            and exposed via standard schemas (DataCite, Dublin Core, Schema.org).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Full-text search</strong> – All archived posts are indexed and
            searchable alongside other scholarly content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Citation export</strong> – Citations can be generated in APA,
            Chicago, MLA, and many other styles, and exported as BibTeX, RIS,
            Citation.js, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multilingual support</strong> – Posts in any language are
            archived; language detection and metadata localization are supported.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open API</strong> – All metadata is freely available via a
            REST API, enabling integration with reference managers, discovery
            systems, and research workflows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communities</strong> – Blogs can be organized into thematic
            communities, making it easy to discover related content.
          </li>
        </ul>
