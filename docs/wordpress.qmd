[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) is the most popular blogging platform for science blogs, and websites in general, powering [about 40%](https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/) of all websites. Wordpress is written in PHP.

### Installation

Wordpress can be self-installed, or used as a hosted version. Many organizations offer hosted Wordpress installations, including [Automattic](https://automattic.com), which runs the [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) service. Wordpress installation includes an API, RSS and Atom feeds.

### Recommended plugins

The [Co-Authors Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/) plugin enables multiple authors per blog post, including guest authors.

The [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin adds a `canonical url` field to each post and can be used to store the DOI of each post as metadata.

### Configuration

Make sure to use the full name in the `Display name publicly as` user settings. You can optionally add the ORCID ID in the `Website` field.
