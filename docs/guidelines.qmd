title: Guidelines
---

These guidelines are recommendations for authors of scholarly blogs to help with long-term archiving, discoverability, and citation of the blog content.
They are modelled after the publication *A Data Citation Roadmap for Scholarly Data Repositories* [@fennerDataCitationRoadmap2019], where many of the same guidelines apply, and where the first author is also involved in Rogue Scholar. Background info about these guidelines is in a blog post [@fennerGuidelinesScholarlyBlogs2023].

These guidelines focus on the required or recommended work for scholarly blog authors. For scholarly blog archives additional guidelines are in development.
